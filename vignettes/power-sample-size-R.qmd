## General Steps 

::: {.incremental}

-   Specify essentials - research question, primary outcome, analysis method
-   Formulate hypothesis
-   Determine effect size (what is a clinically meaningful difference)
-   Desired power and significance level ($1-\beta=0.8$, $\alpha=0.05$)
-   Specify other parameters (e.g. dropout)
-   Calculate sample size
-   Explore uncertainty
